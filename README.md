# Akira's dotfiles
These are the dotfiles I deploy on my machines. Meant to be used with Arch-Linux and its variants. I run Parabola when possible.  

# Programs
-suckless programs: dwm (dynamic window manager), st(simple terminal), dmenu (program runner + much more)  
-SXHKD for keyboard shortcuts  
-feh for wallpaper generation  
-zsh shell  
-xorg for xserver  
-the bin contains scripts that configure my statusbar in dwm
